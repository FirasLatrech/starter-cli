## How TAM CLI Works

### Step 1: Running the Script
To start using TAM CLI, run the script with:
```bash
npm run tam-cli
```
Alternatively, you can run it directly using:
```bash
bash ./cli/tam-cli.sh
```

### Step 2: Navigating the Menu
Once the script runs, it displays a welcome message along with a menu of available actions:
1. **Create Module** – Prompts the user for a module name and directory.
2. **Create Folder** – Prompts the user for a folder name and directory.
3. **Check Hardcoded Colors** – Runs a scan for hardcoded colors in the project.
4. **Automate Git Commit and Push** – Automate Git Commit and Push with Custom or Predefined Messages
5. **Exit** – Closes the CLI.

Users can select an option by entering the corresponding number.

### Step 3: Performing Actions
Depending on the selected option:
- **Creating a Module:**
  - Enter module name and directory.
  - The script runs `create-modules.sh` to generate the module.

- **Creating a Folder:**
  - Enter folder name and directory.
  - The script runs `create-folder.sh` to create the folder.

- **Checking Hardcoded Colors:**
  - The `check-colors.sh` script is executed to analyze color values.

### Step 4: Exiting
The user can exit the script by selecting option `4` or pressing `Ctrl + C`.
